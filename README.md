## AQI
AQI transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single index value which makes it easy to understand. Extent of air pollution and its severity can be mapped by calculating AQI for the respective air pollutants. Increase in AQI indicates increased air pollution and increased chances of threats associated with pollutants to human health.


      
<p> This is Pune city's AQI App data which is collected from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prathmeshn/pune-air-quality-index">Kaggle</a> site, this contains records from the year 2009 to 2019. As the population density increases more and more people are buying vehicles this affects the pollution rates and quality of air.
        The quality of air is measured using the AQI. Basically it's a measure of how pollution affects people's health.</p>
        <p> If the AQI is high then it will cause greater damage to respiratory organs, prior to this people will also find difficulty in breathing and end up developing long term diseases.
            In order to reduce the impact to minimal range it is necessary to keep an eye on the AQI for at least 2-3 days per week.
            Below is range of AQI from minimal to hazardous range.</p>
            
            
                - (0-50)- good
                - (51-100)- satisfactory, might cause little discomfort while breathing
                - (101-200)- moderate pollution, might cause some lung diseases like asthma
                - (201-300)- bad, will cause even more discomfort may also develop heart problems
                - (301-400)- very bad, exposure to this air will cause severe damage and may need oxygen supply
                - (401-500)- hazardous, this will create worst effect on bodies long time exposure will reduce life spam
